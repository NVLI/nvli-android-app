Applications such as VoIP require a delay of less than 150 msecs and packet loss less than 3%. Studies have shown that the latencies achieved by existing handoff implementations can exceed 200 ms and packet loss can exceed 10%. Thus, there is a need for fast handoff solutions, that can meet multimedia traffic requirements. We propose a mechanism for layer-2 fast handoff with the help of background scanning, restricted channel set and preauthentication which does not require any code modification at the access points. The mechanism has been implemented in the MadWiFi wireless open source Linux drivers and tested in an indoor wireless environment.
